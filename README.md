# üç∑ XARELLO: eXploring Adversarial examples using REinforcement Learning Optimisationüç∑

This repository contains the code of XARELLO: a solution for finding adversarial examples and thus testing the robustness of text classifiers,
especially in the tasks of misinformation detection. Unlike other solutions, XARELLO is *adaptive*, i.e. it observes the responses from the
victim classifier and learns, which attacks are succesfull in changing its decisions. This adaptation process is performed using
reinforcement learning, implemented as Q-learning with Transformer-based Q estimator.

The full description of the solution, including the evaluation results, is available in the article [Verifying the Robustness of Automatic Credibility Assessment](TODO),
presented at the [WASSA](https://workshop-wassa.github.io) workshop at ACL 2024. 

The research was done within the [ERINIA](https://www.upf.edu/web/erinia) project realised at the
[TALN lab](https://www.upf.edu/web/taln/) of [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu).

## Installation

To use XARELLO, you will first need to install [BODEGA](https://github.com/piotrmp/BODEGA) -- a benchmark for robustness testing in credibility assessment.
Additionally, XARELLO requires [gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) and [fasttext](https://pypi.org/project/fasttext/). Using CONDA, 
an environment could be prepared through the following:
```commandline
conda create xarello
conda activate xarello
conda install python=3.10
conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -U "transformers==4.38.1"
pip install git+https://gitlab.clarin-pl.eu/syntactic-tools/lambo.git
pip install OpenAttack
pip install editdistance
pip install bert-score
pip install git+https://github.com/lucadiliello/bleurt-pytorch.git
pip install peft bitsandbytes accelerate
pip install gymnasium
pip install fasttext
```
Note that BODEGA source will have to be in your PYTHONPATH for XARELLO to run properly.
