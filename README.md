#üç∑ XARELLO: eXploring Adversarial examples using REinforcement Learning Optimisation

This repository contains the code of XARELLO: a solution for finding adversarial examples and thus testing the robustness of text classifiers,
especially in the tasks of misinformation detection. Unlike other solutions, XARELLO is *adaptive*, i.e. it observes the responses from the
victim classifier and learns, which attacks are succesfull in changing its decisions. This adaptation process is performed using the
reinforcement learning, implemented as Q-learning with Transformer-based Q estimator.

The full description of the solution, including the evaluation results, is available in the article [Verifying the Robustness of Automatic Credibility Assessment](TODO),
presented at the [WASSA](https://workshop-wassa.github.io) workshop at ACL 2024. 

The research was done within the [ERINIA](https://www.upf.edu/web/erinia) project realised at the
[TALN lab](https://www.upf.edu/web/taln/) of [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu).
